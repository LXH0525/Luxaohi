Luxaohi is a programming language built for native Chinese speakers, letting people code in their mother tongue instead of relying only on English keywords.

## Features
- **Native Chinese Keywords**: Write code using familiar Chinese terms instead of English. Examples include `如果` (if), `那么` (then), `变量` (variable), and `喵叫` (meow, the print/output function).
- **Out-of-the-Box**: Distribute as a single EXE file. No installation, dependencies, or complex setup — just download and run.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Core syntax follows patterns common in mainstream languages, lowering the learning barrier for new developers.

## Quick Start
1. Download the latest EXE from the **Download** section below.
2. Double-click the EXE to launch the Luxaohi interpreter.
3. Write and run your first Luxaohi program.

## Simple Example
```
变量 数 = "10"  // Define a variable named "数" (number) with value "10"
喵叫(10 + 数)   // Print the result of 10 + 数 (similar to print/echo in other languages)
```
The `喵叫` (miāo jiào, literally "meow") function is Luxaohi’s built-in output command, equivalent to `print`, `console.log`, or `echo` in other languages.

## Known Issues
- **Environment Compatibility**: Some systems may experience garbled Chinese characters or command-execution errors. As of version 1.5.6 (and still true as of 2026-01-11), Luxaohi works best on **Windows 11**.
- **Browser Security Warnings**: Browsers such as Microsoft Edge may flag the EXE download as potentially unsafe. The Luxaohi interpreter from this repository contains **no malware, viruses, or harmful code**.
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Small mismatches between documentation and actual behavior may exist, often due to subtle code bugs. If you notice inconsistencies, feel free to open an issue to help improve accuracy.
